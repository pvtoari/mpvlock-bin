`mpvlock-bin` is an unofficial repackaging of the `mpvlock` screen locker utility for Hyprland, bundled with its required runtime library (`libhyprutils.so.5`) and configuration assets. This repository aims to preserve functionality for legacy users, as the original sources have been taken offline.
